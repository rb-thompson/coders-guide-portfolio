# The Coder's Guide to the Portfolio Project

Welcome to **The Coder's Guide to the Portfolio Project**, a cosmic-themed web app designed to guide aspiring coders through interactive quests, helping them build portfolio-worthy confidence while learning key skills and exciting tech news. I created this solo, with a bit of AI assistance and GitHub to track my journeyâ€”hoping it catches the eye.

## What It Does

Embark on a journey through the Data Galaxy where you, a coder, must navigate toward the prize.

- **Complete Quests**: Drag-and-drop challenges like "Explore the Cosmic Console" to master coding concepts.

- **Track Progress**: Collect badges and watch quests mark as completed with a *satisfying* checkmark. 

- **Showcase Skills**: A portfolio piece that's both functional and fun.



## Tech Stack

> "We don't learn new tools just for the sake of it." - Jeffrey W.

Built with modern tools I've learned to love:

- **Next.js**: For a fast, dynamic frontend with the App Router.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Easy and beautiful responsive styling.

- **Framer Motion**: Subtle animations.

- **React Context & localStorage**: User state management (until the backend spins)

- **GitHub**: Tracked every step of my five-day sprint.



## How I Built It

This project was a labor of love for *the process*â€”hours of coding, debugging, and learning over five days. I started with a vision: a gamified portfolio to stand out. With AI as a coding companion and GitHub to log my progress (check the [commit history](https://github.com/rb-thompson/coders-guide-portfolio/commits/main/)), I tackled challenges like Next.js Promise-based params, deployment hiccups, and state bugs. It's not perfect, but it's mineâ€”and Iâ€™m proud of it.
